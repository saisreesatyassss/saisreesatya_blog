## 💡 Interview Tips I've Learned

### 🎤 **Behavioral Interviews**
- **STAR method** is your best friend (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- **Prepare 5-6 stories** that showcase different skills
- **Practice out loud** - it sounds different than thinking in your head

### 💻 **Technical Interviews**
- **Think out loud** - even if you're stuck, explain your thought process
- **Ask clarifying questions** - shows you think about edge cases
- **Start simple** - get a working solution first, then optimize

### 🏢 **Company Research**
- **Know their recent news** - product launches, funding, acquisitions  
- **Understand their tech stack** - shows genuine interest
- **Prepare thoughtful questions** - treat it as a two-way conversation
